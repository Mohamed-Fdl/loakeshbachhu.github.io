            <h2>my-experiences:$<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
            <p>
                I have been working as a backend developer for the past three years. I started my career as a freelancer, working on a variety of projects for clients in different industries. In May 2022, I joined <a href="http://aws.bj/">All Web Services</a>                as a backend developer, where I have been working on a number of projects (such as <a href="https://www.kloo.me/">Kloo</a> & <a href="https://sevexchange.com/">Sevexchange</a> ) for clients in the Benin area. <br> <br> In each of these
                projects, I was responsible for implementing the backend logic to integrate with the frontend, as well as handling database communications and business logic. I have also gained experience working with a team and communicating with clients
                to ensure that the final product meets their needs. <br> <br> I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a backend developer. If you have a project that you think might be a good fit for my skills and experience,
                don't hesitate to reach out!
